A “Dynamic Load Balancing Simulator” is typically a software tool that lets you model a distributed or
cloud system and experiment with how different dynamic load‑balancing algorithms move work between nodes
in real time to improve performance and resource utilization. You can treat it as a mini lab where you 
generate jobs, route them to servers with various strategies, and observe metrics like response time, 
throughput, and CPU utilization.

Core idea
Dynamic load balancing means the system decides during runtime how to distribute tasks based on current load,
instead of fixing the mapping beforehand. A simulator lets you replay many “what if” scenarios without needing 
real hardware, which is very useful for research and B.Tech‑level projects.

Key concepts your content can cover:
-> System model: set of processing elements (servers/VMs/cores), each with its own processing speed and queue.
-> Dynamic decisions: when to migrate tasks, which node to pick, how many tasks to move, and which exact  
   tasks to move.
