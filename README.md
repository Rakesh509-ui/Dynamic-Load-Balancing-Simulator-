A “Dynamic Load Balancing Simulator” is typically a software tool that lets you model a distributed or
cloud system and experiment with how different dynamic load‑balancing algorithms move work between nodes
in real time to improve performance and resource utilization. You can treat it as a mini lab where you 
generate jobs, route them to servers with various strategies, and observe metrics like response time, 
throughput, and CPU utilization.
